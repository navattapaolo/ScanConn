WDgn allows you to see connections as you would by running "netstat" in the terminal, but scanning them with virustotal.
 If you are not sure that malware has been removed completely you can run this tool!

There are some steps you have to follow before you start:

1. Extract the . rar file to a folder or clone the repo where you want the files to be located.

2. Create an account or login to VirusTotal, click on your name at the top right and go to "API Key", copy your key and paste it into the file "API-key.txt".

3. (optional) Add the Wdgn.exe's folder (for Windows) or the netstat file (for Linux) as a system PATH.
