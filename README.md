WDgn allows you to see connections as you would by running "netstat" in the terminal, but scanning them with virustotal.
 If you are not sure that malware has been removed completely you can run this tool!

There are some steps you have to follow before you start:

1. Extract the . rar file to a folder, located where you want the files to be located.

2. Create an account or login to VirusTotal, click on your name at the top right and go to "API Key", copy your key and paste it into the file "API-key.txt".

3. (optional) Add the Wdgn.exe file's folder as a system variable, to do this first copy the path of the folder you extracted where all the files are located, then look in the navigation bar for "Change system-related environment variables"
open the software, click on the option "Environment variables", go to "System variables", and scroll until you see the variable "Path", click "Edit", go to "New" and copy the path of the folder you copied earlier.
Now in the cmd you can type "netcheck" to run WDgn.exe.
